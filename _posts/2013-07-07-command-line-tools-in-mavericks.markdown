## Things have changed

In previes releases of Xcode, you went into ``Preferences`` and then to the ``Downloads`` tab, and choose to download and install ``Command Line Tools``. In Xcode 5 this have changed. It have been removed, and a new way is intodused. The best part of the new way, is that you don't even have to install Xcode 5 to get Command Line Tools anymore.

## The new way

1.  Open up an terminal (Terminal.app or iTerm2.app)

3.  Click on "install" to start the installation wizzard.
