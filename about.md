I'm a 36 old guy who is currently working as a [systems administrator][4] at [Basefarm AS][1], a hosting company here in [Oslo, Norway][2].
In my spare time, I play around with photographing, gadgets Linux, Mac OS X and reading / listening to books. I'm also an avid TV-series / movies buff. My favorite author is [Nelson DeMille][3].
